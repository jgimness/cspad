# NOTE: Merge file comments begin with "#"
# this file contains the list of scripts, templates, and service proxies to be combined
# typically order is important for scripts

# concatenating files reduces the number of downloads, each of which incurs a connection cost
# compacting the files removes all comments and insignificant whitespace
# finally, if the browser supports it the resulting content will be GZipped or Deflated
# content can be directly in the project or embedded in linked assemblies
# merge files can even merge other merge files

# add all of the JsonFx scripts at once
JsonFx.Scripts.JsonFx.merge, JsonFx.Client
